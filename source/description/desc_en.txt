Organon is an organisation and navigation-tool for OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

Organon creates a navigation-tree for folders and files 

It's possible to:

- use drag and drop
- create tags in treeview and sidebar
- import and export files
- organize the project in tabs

While working within folders Organon keeps the reference to the edited file in the navigation-tree.
