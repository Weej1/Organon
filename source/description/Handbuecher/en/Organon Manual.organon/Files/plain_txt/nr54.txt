Html Export
Organon's HTML Export is an alternative to the HTML Export of OO / LO . Organon's HTML Export creates a much more reduced and better set outlay.
The idea was to obtain an output to be inserted quickly and easily by using copy and paste into your own HTML projects.

The following formats can optionally be used for the output:
bold
italic
Alignment (left , right, center , block)
headings
footnotes
colors
hyperlinks

Other formats (quotes) or images are not (yet) be exported.
