Tags

Tags Categories are freely configurable.
Name and width (in the Organizer view in cm) existing categories will be changed by changing the entry and then clicking on "Apply".
For a new category, enter the name and width and choose a category type. There are five types:
Text (body text)
Tag (Classical tag, collection of single words or short phrases)
Image (only one image per category)
Date
Time
To change the order of categories, select a category and use the arrow keys.
The selected category is deleted by "Delete Category".
The representation of the date can be changed by selecting the Date Format. A date must always be entered according to the date format.

By clicking "Apply" the changes take effect.

Each type of category can be created several times.

Picture Categories slow down Organon and the Organizer, particularly if large images are used. At the moment no thumbnails for images are created, which would speed up the display.
