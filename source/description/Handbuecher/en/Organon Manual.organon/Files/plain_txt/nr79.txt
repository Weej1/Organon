Templates

Choose Folder
To make Organon templates available, a template folder has to be selected. The folder can freely be chosen on the users disk. Organon recognizes all folders inside this folder with the name: “<Name>.organon” as Organon templates.

Save current project as template
Saves the current project under the name, which was entered into the textfield, to the template folder.
Organon Templates are usual Organon projects. Therefor it's possible, simply to copy Organon projects, the user wishes to use as a template, into this folder. 

Delete Template
Deletes the selected template. Forever.
If the template is removed outwards of Organon from the template folder, it isn't available anymore as well.


If the Organon Template has been created from a project with a Writer template, the Organon template will contain the Writer template also.
