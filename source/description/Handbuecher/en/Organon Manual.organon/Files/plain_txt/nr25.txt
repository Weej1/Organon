Show Text Sections:
For a better user experience the text section boundaries can be toggled.

In LO the function turns off of both text boundaries and area boundaries .
In OO , the area boundaries need to be switched off separately:
Tools / Settings / OpenOffice / Appearance / Area Borders

The function is accessible in Writer as View / Text Boundaries also.
