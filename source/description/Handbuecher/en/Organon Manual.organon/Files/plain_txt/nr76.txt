Devide Text (Batch)

With the function “Devide Text (Batch)” a file can be divided into multiple files and folders at once.

The searchterm divides the source text before the occurrence of the searchterm.
The word search is not case sensitive.

Regular expression corresponds in its operation to the Writer search.

The option Blank Lines divides the text in occurrences of blank lines.

When Headings are selected, the text is divided according to its headers in the default formatting (heading, heading1, heading2 etc.).

While the searchterm and blank lines create files, headings are created as a folder. The headings are mirrored in their hierarchy in the newly created folders. 

The source file will be kept.
