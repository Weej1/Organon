Logic
The way the results are combined can be controlled by the logic signs to the right.

˅ = OR
˄ = AND
(Default is OR)

˅: The results of each selection will be added.
	Example: 	The results of 'tags sidebar' are: Scene 1, Scene 2
			The results of 'tags treeview' are: Scene 2, Scene 3
			The total result will be: Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3

˄: Only results which appear in both selections will be added.
	Example: 	The results of 'tags sidebar' are: Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3
			The results of 'tags treeview' are: Scene 3, Scene 4, Scene 5
			The total result will be: Scene 3

'tags sidebar' does have the same logic sign. So you can also choose between: 
	select all files which hold one of the selected tags (OR)
	select all files which hold all of the selected tags (AND)

For instance: This logic might be useful to find either all scenes where at least one of two characters appear, or only the scenes where both characters appear.
