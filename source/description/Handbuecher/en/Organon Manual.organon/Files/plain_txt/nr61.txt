Text Comparison: Find Quotes
This text tool finds common points in two texts being compared, creats a browser with document navigation options between related references and opens the document in the browser. Depending on the intent of the searcher the tool finds citations or plagiarism.
It takes only literally exactly the same points, but extended punctuation and upper and lower case does not matter.

Example:
Output sentence: I am a child with horn-rimmed glasses on my nose.
Will be found: I am a child. (With horn-rimmed glasses - on my nose).
Will not be found : I am. * A child with horn and spectacles on my nose
("On my nose" is found when the number of search words is 3.)

Internal and external texts can be compared. Formats for external texts are: .txt, .odt, .doc 
The number of keywords can be chosen freely. Minimum number: 3
The larger the compared texts and the smaller the minimum value is selected, the longer the search will need.
The navigation bar of the browser document can be ordered either alphabetical or chronological (on emergence of the reference in the second text).
