Separator formatting
There are four options for the formatting of the separator :
Line
Color with inscription
User Defined
No Separator


Color: 
The color of font and background can be selected. The value must be a hexadecimal value. For a color picker, see the Web as under : 
http://www.colorpicker.com/
Or in Writer under Extras / Settings / Libre- , OpenOffice / Colors / Edit
You can choose a color or click the eyedropper and get the hexadecimal color values displayed​​among the Hex #.

Custom:
You can choose an icon or an image as a separator . An icon appears in the center of the line. A picture should have approximately the dimensions of the separator, wich gets displayed with the selection color, to be not too distorted . Try yourself!
