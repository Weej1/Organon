Scrolling:
If files and folders need more space than the Organon window offers, a scrollbar will be shown.

Unfortunately the scrollbar can't be moved by the mousewheel. I couldn't find an (easy) solution for using the mousewheel with Office. 
Scrolling the mouse wheel :
Scrolling the mouse wheel can be activated in the preferences (Windows and Linux) .
File / Preferences / Mouse Wheel
The mouse wheel can be used in the tree view and the dialogs, when a scrollbar exists. The wheel can also be used during the drag and drops to reach parts of the tree that are outside of the display .

The library X11 must be installed in Linux. (In Ubuntu its part of the standard install .)
If you have problems (Slow display or error messages ) disable the mouse wheel again.
