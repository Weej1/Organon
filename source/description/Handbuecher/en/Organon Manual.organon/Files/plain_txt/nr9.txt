Import

Selection
Import File or Folder

Keep Folder Structure
Folders can be imported in two ways:
without folder structure:
Organon will set all imported files into one folder
with folder structure:
Organon will reflect the folder structure of the imported folder

Filter
Only Files with the corresponding filter will be imported. (Only upon folder import)

Filter, User Selection
This is an experimental feature and some of the filters don't work (pdf for instance, as the filter imports to a Draw document). As OO and LO offer a lot of filters, you can try to use them on demand.
Writer might crash or destroy your project.
It is recommended to import to a newly created project, export from there to .odt and reimport to the target project.
