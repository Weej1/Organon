Design
The design setting has three columns:
Color Selection
Selection of the design
Managing designs


In the column with the color picker, the colors can be customized for each entry. The change is not permanent and is lost with the selection of a design or closing of Office.
To save the edit, a new design has to be created. Therefor add a name in the textbox which does not exist and choose "New Design".

In the middle column, the designs are switched. Changes are immediately visible.

In the right column, the designs are managed:


New design creates a new design from the current colors. To create a new design, any other can be selected and changed. (The changes are not saved to the selected design). Only with the creation of a new design the changes get permanent.
Delete: Deletes the selected design.
Export: Exports a .json file with any name to any location. The file can be used as a backup or for sharing with other Office installations, for example to exchange designs between the laptop and desktop computer. Files can be exchanged between LO and OO.
Import: Imports a .json design file. Designs with the same name are checked for their compliance. With complete equality the design is not imported, a file with the suffix "_old" is otherwise provided.
