Create Project

Project name:
Name the project.
Please note: The project can not be renamed . In order to provide the project with a new name , it needs to be exported as a project . ( File / Export / Export as / new project )

Save to folder: 
Choose a folder. Organon will create a folder with the name:
“<project name>.organon”

( Linux ) Make sure that you have write permissions for the folder .

Formatting:
See next entry: Formatting

Templates:
You can either use Writer templates or Organon templates. Organon templates might be created with Writer templates.

Writer Templates
Choose a template for the new project from user templates. Only user templates are shown by Organon. To choose a template, the check box has to be checked AND a template has to be chosen.

On creating a user template see:
OO:
https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Getting_Started/Creating_a_template
LO:
https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Templates_and_Styles

The template will be saved with the project. To change the template afterwards, search for the following file:
<project folder>/files/odt/template.ott

This file can be edited and saved again. On the next opening of the project, the edited template will be used.

Organon Templates
Organon templates are usual Organon projects, which will be saved with a new name and under a new path, and are available as a new project. These templates can be used to create a new project with a structure as required or to contain prefabricated files or folders (a titelpage for example).

To use an Organon Template, a folder containing Organon templates has to be chosen.
For further information see the manual under:
Organon Menu/File/Preferences/Templates
