###Organon is a tool for novelists and scientific authors.

Organon is a plugin for LibreOffice and OpenOffice.

Organon allows to split up large texts into parts, allows tagging and opening parts of the project in new tabs.

Parts are shown in a treeview. Entries can be moved by drag and drop.
Every entry can be tagged.
Tags are freely configurable, can be renamed, created and deleted. Organon's Organizer is a fast way of showing and editing all tags at once.
Tabs can be opened based on these tags. They also might freely be chosen from the folders and files of the project and they might be sorted by date and/or time.

Organon offers extensive import and export options.
Organon's projects are platform independent and might be edited on different computers and platforms.

####More Features are:
* (Batch) split and combine files
* When displaying the files in a folder, the relevant section of the folder is always highlighted while editing the document. 
* Separator, configurable by the user. When viewing a folder the separator separates the files optically from each other. 
* Import of individual files. All filters available for Writer can be used.
* Import a folder of files (Batch Import), filterable by extension
* Export an arbitrary part of the project in a single file or an entire document. All Writer filters are available (.odt, .doc, .pdf ...). (Batch Export)
* (Batch) Export to LaTex files
* (Batch) Export to HTML files. In addition, alternative Organon Filter for easier layout of the HTML file.
* Create a single click backup of the project
* Several tags in the tree view:
  * Colors
  * Custom Icons
  * Scientific counting
* Text Tools:
  * Find quotes: text comparison of two texts and finding all common points. The result is stored as a browser document. All results are linked and can be accessed directly via a navigation.
  * Create Word List: A list of all words used are saved as Calc file. Chronological or alphabetical order.
  * Generate index: specialized tool for index creation in texts with counting (eg ancient texts or text-critical editions). The result is a navigable browser document.
