Don't use Organon with LibreOffice 5x at the moment.
###Organon is an organisation and navigation-tool for writer (LibreOffice and OpenOffice)

Organon creates a project with a directory tree for easy navigation between files and folders of the project. Arbitrary parts of the project can be opened in Tabs.

Organon creates a new entry in the sidebar, where several tags for all items can be assigned. 

In addition, Organon has a collection of text tools and extensive import and export options (batch import and export).

####Features:
* Drag and Drop
* Awarding Tags
* Organizer: fast and simple way to show and edit all tags
* Open Parts of the Project in Tabs
* When displaying the files in a folder, the relevant section of the folder is always highlighted while editing the document.
* Separator, configurable by the user. When viewing a folder the separator separates the files optically from each other.
* Import of individual files. All filters available for Writer can be used.
* Import a folder of files, filterable (Batch Import)
* Export an arbitrary part of the project in a single file or an entire document. All Writer filters are available (.odt, .doc, .pdf ...). (Batch Export)
* (Batch) Export to LaTex files
* (Batch) Export to HTML files. In addition, alternative Organon Filter for easier and smoother layout of the HTML file.

  * Create Word List: A list of all words used are saved as Calc file. Chronological or alphabetical order.
  * Generate index: specialized tool for index creation in texts with counting (eg ancient texts or text-critical editions). The result is a navigable browser document.
